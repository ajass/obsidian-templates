## Linking & Tagging Guide

### Tags to Consider Adding:
- `#list/[category]` - Topic: `#list/books`, `#list/recipes`, `#list/tools`
- `#list/wishlist` - Things you want
- `#list/reference` - Information for lookup
- `#list/project/[name]` - Project-specific lists

### When to Split (Keep Atomic!):
If your list covers multiple topics, consider splitting:
- One note per category: `Books to Read` → separate from `Books I've Read`
- Single-concept focus: "Travel destinations" vs "Travel planning"

### Linking Tips:
- **Conceptual neighbors**: Link to related concepts: `[[creativity]]`, `[[productivity]]`
- **Source notes**: Link to where this list came from
- **Project links**: Connect to any projects this list supports

### Move Toward Evergreen:
1. #intake → #seedling: Add context for each item, why it matters
2. #seedling → #evergreen: Ensure single focus, add concept links
3. #overgrown? Consider splitting into multiple atomic lists
